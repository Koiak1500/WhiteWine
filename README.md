Hi guys!

My name's Koiak, I'm 23 years old. I live in Brazil, I like chocolate, coca-cola, strawberry with condensed milk, pizza, spaghetti... I really love eat! I like spending my time with roleplay, games and other stuff xD
I'm a newbie with coding. I would like to learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you are interested in spending some of your time teaching a beginner, just contact me by email. I wanted too soon after my coding "Graduation", can get a project. If you want to participate just talk with me. We will exchange ideas on how it goes this project  and how it can be used to make the life easier for people.
A big hug! Hope you can help me with coding!
